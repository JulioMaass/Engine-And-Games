Reorganize:
Make physics a static class
Game specific stuff
	Later - HUD (player HP, etc)
	- Special states (slide, topdown walk, etc)
	Later - Global Values (not implemented yet - bolts, lives, etc)
	- GenerateEntityList()
	- Component templates (AddMmdbEnemyComponents)
	- Verify GameSpecificSettings.CurrentGame uses
Turn into options, instead of conditional compilation:
	BufferDamage/ApplyBufferedDamage (should be an auto property of entities that have iFrames - friendly take the smallest damage, foes take the biggest)
	// Only transition up with state climb
	// Update some player properties

	- Destroying tiles shouldn't potentially destroy tiles in the save file
	- Be able to deactivate entity respawning without deleting them from layout

Menu improvements:
	- Refresh IntendedX/Y when pressing "against a wall"
	- Option to warp
