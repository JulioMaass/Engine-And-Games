Asteroids
- Less, stronger asteroids, so the player can focus on dodging and counter attacking
- Preview enemies before each wave
- Waves of themed enemies that can counter your strategy, so you need to adapt
- Asteroid waves need some other themes besides asteroid types (like coming from the side(s)/back, and powers bigger/faster/more)
- More wave themes: coming from teleporter, black hole on screen, 

Power ups
- More expensive weapons
- Once you buy a weapon/socket, it should be unlocked and easy to swap
- Just one socket for each weapon (except basic one maybe). 2 sockets + weapon effect feels too diluted (gets 3 out of 4 powers)
- It needs to be harder to get to higher levels, otherwise challenge becomes too trivial too fast
- Each weapon can level up and maybe have a skilltree

Content
- More asteroids, weapons and powerups, to make runs less samey
- Implement missiles, so you can buy stuff even when you can't afford upgrades (should be presented 1st to the player?)
- Super: can cast once per wave, max
