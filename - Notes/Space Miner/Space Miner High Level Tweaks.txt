- Make 4 tiers of asteroids (2 sizes each)
	- Higher tiers have more hp and better abilities and drop more ores;
	- Use palette shader to draw all colors;
- Rename ores (Speedium, Toughsten, Splitton, Magnetite, Blast, Flakker)
- Make upgrades require gray ores
	- All asteroids drop some gray ore
- Make shops
- Choose route after each section (or groups of sections?)

- Difficulty scaling:
	- Difficulty doubles every 3-4 levels
	- Should be able to upgrade main weapon every 5 levels
	- Missiles and supers should handle the "remaining difficulty"
