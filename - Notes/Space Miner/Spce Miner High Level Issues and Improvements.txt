High Level Issues/Improvements
	- Stuff to buy with all ores
	- Stuff competing for your attention (2+ different items that use the same ores)
		- Player should have conflicting desires (damage/coverage/attraction/defense/survivability/shortOrLongTerm/mobility...)
		- Multiple types for the same(ish) thing (ex: damage or attack speed)
		- Competing strategies (make mine barrier or make black hole trap and damage)
	- Show prices as icons
	- Show gathered resources as icons
	- Dont allow buying missiles when stack is full
	- Show missiles as icons (and allow multiple missile types on the stack)
	- There should be a threat when you are OP (like purple bullets)
		- Balance game to make later asteroids harder to destroy
		- Level 2 asteroids have aditional threats (damage over time, etc)
	- High damage is OP, make shot get smaller every hit?
	- Radial collision
