Space Miner Foundations
- Use minerals to make weapons/parts/upgrades
	- All minerals can be used as mods, but specific mixes/amounts for equipment/upgrade tier
- Have sub weapons and supers that use ammo (or cooldown)
- Slots:
	- Weapon + Socket Mods
	- Missile
	- Super/Bomb
	- Armor/Passive
	- Unique Upgrades? (mutation/downwell upgrades vibes)

Space Miner Questions
- How to make the runs diverse in a crafting game?
	YES - Runs have different minerals, so players need to make different equipment;
	YES - Some enemies counter specific builds, so players need to adapt;
	YES - Unlocking new blueprints makes the player curious to try new (better) equipment;
	YES - Modifiers/chars(starting weapons/passives) incentivize different builds;
	YES - Achievements: Some builds are better for specific objectives;
- Crafting or customizable? (or both?)
	YES - Both. Craft parts, upgrade/mod with minerals
- How to avoid the customization being diluted (10% of everything instead of 200% attack speed + level 5 pierce)
	YES - Limited slots for modding. Each slot gets 1 type, but each type can be upgraded)
- How to allow for skill expression (positive feedback, instead of negative; also higher skill ceiling)
- Should ammo be the raw minerals, or craft them?
	YES - Raw minerals for ammo, but some missiles/supers may be crafted and cast
- Improve station and unlock blueprints?
	YES - Unlock blueprints to tutorialize progress (less overwhelming). May be able to buy some blueprints on meta game.
	YES - Special blueprints are unlocked via achievements
- Mix rarity with elemental typing?
	YES - Elemental typing for mods, rarity for size/amount
	YES - Rare metals for special effects (black hole, just need 1 to socket), or special crafts (ultra attract needs 1 black hole);
- Modular customization, or slots?
	YES - Slots per type. 1 weapon, 1 armor, 1 missile, 1 super...
- What triggers shop? May be frustrating go to shop/crafting and be unable to get upgrades.
	YES - Time/Mission complete. Just make sure that the player has resources early on via balance. 
	- NT approach: Skip if there are no upgrades available
	- Get a "mutation" regardless of being able to buy equipment?
	- Basic metals cheap upgrades (damage +1%)
	- Time? Basic mineral (xp/slot creator?)
	- Forced to loan, to get at least one upgrade (lol?)
	- Have other stuff to do other than crafting in the shop screen? (Sell/trade minerals?)
	- Very cheap items available (temporary boosts/special ammo)?
	- Basic metal(s) always has some damage/number stats to boost?
	- Simply balance the game to have enought minerals to craft? Limit crafting to 1 per stop, to avoid crafting 5 equips, and then can't craft anything in the next stop?
	- Discounts for random crafts (like Ufo50's Overbold)
	- Choose next stage, or increase difficulty by adding minerals to the run?
	- Use basic mineral to heal?
	- Every roguelike with shops have the chance to no be able to buy anything. Just avoid it happening on 1st stop
- How to get better tier equipment? Upgrade current equipment, or substitute it? Pros and cons
	- Upgrade, but be able to substitute for tier 1 and then upgrade the new equip. (can sell unnused equip?)
- Weapon upgrades slots amount is linked to spaceship or weapon? Can craft weapons or each char has it's own?
	- Initial test: Weapon upgrades per weapon; Can craft weapons (chars may have initial default weapons)
- Can remove socketed minerals from weapons?
	- Can remove but has a cost(?)
- Bag for unnused equipment?
	- Initial test: Sell, to avoid clutter
- Basic metal (xp): Used to unlock slots during runs? Slots are simply char based?
	- Used to unlock, and tutorialize the first few loops
	- Used for basic stats progress (damage/hp), in run/meta?
- Tradeoffs to make metals balanced? 
	NO - Multi reduces damage, blast reduces rapid...?
	YES - Each weapon has its own quirks on modding (machinegun gets a small blast, slugger gets a big one; machine gun gets a small angle from multi, slugger gets more; etc)


Roguelike route (Downwell/Spelunky/Nuclear Throne)
- Weapons: Random, switch
- Upgrades: Stack (limited options), long run (via xp/stage clear/exploration)
- Drops: Keep engaged, custom choices/meta progression

- Low skill (Drops)
- High skill (Temporary/During Run)
- 




Chars:
- Collector: Can't upgrade equipment, swap for new ones instead. Swapped equipment can be used to start new runs.
- Bullet Muncher: Uses minerals as ammo, but is stronger (may be a weapon trait too)
- Different focus characters: May have extra slots for weapons, upgrades, hull, missile, super
- Don't use ammo for supers, but has cooldown instead
